## Key Functionality

### adventureQuest

A client side function, listening for a click event, that makes a request to the sever, which in turn queries the database.
It was particularly interesting because we used the URL to give the primary key for the "AdventureQuest" that was creted.

```javascript
adventureQuest.on("click", async () => {
  aid = await getAid();
  qid = await getQid();
  const res = await fetch(`api/adventurequest`, {
    method: "POST",
    body: JSON.stringify({ adventurerId: aid, questId: qid }),
    headers: {
      "Content-Type": "application/json",
    },
  });
  if (res.ok) {
    res.json().then((data) => {
      const aq = data.pk.id;
      document.location.replace(`gameplay/${aq}`);
    });
  }
});
```

### Game Mechanics - The Brain

Once the Questmaster choses a quest and adventurer, the stats of the quest monster are calculated against the adventurer stats to determine one winner per battle.

We are comparing the Adventurer's stats to the Monsters.  This way either monster or adventurer have a legitimate advantage based on a particular strength or weakness.

We boil this comparison down to a fraction of 1 (or percentage), then apply class advantage, difficulty rating of the monster itself, and the monsters respective attribute.

```javascript
function gameMechanics(adventurer, quest) {
  var strWinPercentage = (adventurer.strength * adventurer.class.strMultiplier) / 100 + quest.difficulty + (0 - quest.monsterStr / 100);
  var dexWinPercentage = (adventurer.dexterity * adventurer.class.dexMultiplier) / 100 +  quest.difficulty + (0 - quest.monsterDex / 100);
  var intWinPercentage = (adventurer.intelligence * adventurer.class.intMultiplier) / 100 + quest.difficulty + (0 - quest.monsterInt / 100);
```

Once we have our fraction per stat, enter math random.

Math random chooses a number between 0 and 1 and our fraction acts as the over/under for our conditional statement.

So now we need to way to determine which stat we will use; enter math random again!  We use it to pick a number from 1 to 3 with each number representing a stat.  This all fits snuggly within a while loop that runs so long as both parties are alive.  Once someone dies, we have a winner and the loop exits.

```javascript
  while (monsterHitPoints > 0 && adventurerHitPoints > 0) {
    if (Math.random() < fightArray[i] + adventurerPower) {
      damage = Math.ceil(Math.floor((Math.random() * 3) + 1) + adventurerPower);
      damageString = damageString.concat(damage.toString() + '|');
      injuryString = injuryString.concat(' ' + '|');
      battleString = battleString.concat(dealtDamageArr[Math.floor((Math.random() * (dealtDamageArr.length - 1)) + 1)] + '|');
      monsterHitPoints = monsterHitPoints - damage;
      monsterHPStr = monsterHPStr.concat(monsterHitPoints.toString() + '|');
      adventurerHPStr = adventurerHPStr.concat(adventurerHitPoints.toString() + '|');
      if (i === fightArray.length - 1) {
        i = 0;
      } else {
        i = i + 1;
      }
    } else {
      injury = Math.ceil(Math.floor((Math.random() * 5) + 1) - adventurerPower);
      injuryString = injuryString.concat(injury.toString() + '|');
      damageString = damageString.concat(' ' + '|');
      battleString = battleString.concat(tookDamageArr[Math.floor((Math.random() * (tookDamageArr.length - 1)) + 1)] + '|');
      adventurerHitPoints = adventurerHitPoints - injury;
      adventurerHPStr = adventurerHPStr.concat(adventurerHitPoints.toString() + '|');
      monsterHPStr = monsterHPStr.concat(monsterHitPoints.toString() + '|');
      if (i === fightArray.length - 1) {
        i = 0;
      } else {
        i = i + 1;
      }
    }
  }
```

### router.get("/questBoard")

This was a key route in our program because it gets all data for the current users adventurers, as well as all quests
made by any QuestMaster registered on AdventureQuest. It then sends all of the information to the Handlebars template.

```javascript
router.get("/questBoard", auth, async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const questData = await Quest.findAll({
      order: [["created_at", "DESC"]],
    });

    const adventurerData = await Adventurer.findAll({
      include: [{ model: Class }],
      order: [["created_at", "DESC"]],
      where: { questMasterId: req.session.questMasterId },
    });

    //serializedata
    const quests = questData.map((quest) => quest.get({ plain: true }));
    const adventurers = adventurerData.map((adventure) =>
      adventure.get({ plain: true })
    );

    res.render("questBoard", {
      quests,
      adventurers,
      logged_in: req.session.logged_in,
    });
  } catch (err) {
    console.log("Error fetching data");
  }
});
```

## Summary and Learning Points

### Sid
This was an extremely fun application to build. Not only because of my team, but because we got to be creative. We had to find solutions to "problems" that we "created" ourselves, and I really enjoyed the process. I enjoyed working in a group, and definitely learned a lot about how I personally deal with teamwork.

### Brennan
This project was wonderfully collaborative.  It's success can be attributed in no small measure to our ability to work together as a team.  I was lucky to be able to work with these two on this project.  We kept the atmosphere light and fun, which I maintain contributed to our productivity.

### Krystopher
This project was amazing from our problem solving to our pair workflow. I really enjoyed working with my partners not only were they very knowledgeable but great at teaching and working with each other. Most motivated and hard working team I've been a part of.
